# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine program
For this project a Music dataset from Amazon Vine review program was selected. 
PySpark has been used to perform the ETL process, to connect to an AWS RDS instance and load the transform data into pgAdmin. 
The final purpose of the analysis is to determine is there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the selected dataset.  This analysis could be performed by using either PySpark, Pandas or SQL. In this particular case PySpark was the chosen approach. 

# Results
Quantity of Vine Reviews.
Quantity of Non-Vine Reviews. 
Quantity of Vine Reviews with 5 Stars.
Quantity of non-Vine Reviews with 5 Stars



There is a bulleted list that addresses the three questions for unpaid and paid program reviews 

Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:


How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

Summary:
In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
The summary states whether or not there is bias, and the results support this statement 
An additional analysis is recommended to support the statement
